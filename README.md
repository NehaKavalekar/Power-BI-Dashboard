#Ola Vehicle Data Analytics Dashboard
This project is a comprehensive data analytics solution designed for Ola vehicle data. Using Power BI and SQL, the dashboard provides deep insights into key performance metrics such as ride trends, revenue, driver performance, and customer behavior. SQL is used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), while Power BI visualizes the data with interactive charts and reports.

One of the standout features of this dashboard is the implementation of navigation buttons in Power BI, allowing users to seamlessly jump between different pages, enhancing the user experience.

This project aims to support data-driven decision-making by offering clear and actionable insights into Ola's operations.
